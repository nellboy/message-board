# message-board

A simple message board using Grunt, Yeoman, Angular, and Jasmine

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate my use of these tools for application development, since much of my work in recent times has been with private repositories, which I cannot publicly show.

Possible next steps here would be to write messages to the local messages.json file to allow users to save messages. It would also be useful to refresh every 10 seconds to update the page with messages from other users.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.

## Prerequisites

Running this application assumes a basic working knowledge of npm modules.
